<p>Basti Ki Pathshala is a grassroots educational initiative dedicated to bringing learning opportunities to underprivileged children living in urban slums. With limited access to formal schooling, many of these children are at risk of dropping out or never attending school at all. Basti Ki Pathshala acts as a bridge between these marginalized communities and quality education, providing free classes, moral support, and a safe learning environment.</p>
